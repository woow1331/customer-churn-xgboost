#  Customer Churn Prediction Project (XGBoost + Feature Engineering)

##  Project Overview
This project predicts customer churn based on the **Telco Customer Churn Dataset**.  
Using a full ML pipeline with `XGBoost`, we handle class imbalance, evaluate model performance (AUC 0.82), and interpret predictions through feature importance.

> ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:** Help businesses identify customers likely to leave and take proactive retention actions.

##  Feature Importance

Top influential features:
1. Contract_Two year
2. InternetService_Fiber optic
3. Contract_One year
4. InternetService_No

> ðŸ“Œ Long-term contracts significantly reduce churn risk.
